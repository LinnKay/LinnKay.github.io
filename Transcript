My name is Kadriana Armstrong and I am a recent high honors graduate of Lawrence County High School in Monticello, Mississippi. I would describe myself as outgoing, adventurous, intelligent, and confident in all that I do. I am hardworking and determined to reach all set goals. One of the things I firmly believe in is community outreach and service; give help whenever you can because you never know who or how you are influencing someone. Leadership and involvement are, also, dear to me. In high school, I was selected to be apart of The National Honors Society, senior representative of Student Council, Diamond Dolls, Invisible  Children, and Interact Club. One of my greatest accomplishments was being selected to participate on a student-administrator panel to revise the school and district policies.
